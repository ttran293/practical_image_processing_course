## **From Problem to Result**
- **Problem**
- **Acquiisition** to capture
- **Preprocessing** to improve the quality of the aquired image. Possible algorithms
- **Segmentation** is responsible for partitioning an image into its main components, into relevant foreground objects and background.
- **Feature Extraction** is also known as representation and description block and consists of algorithms responsible for encoding the image content in a concise and descriptive way.
- **Classification** Techniques such as minimum distance classifiers probabilistic classifiers, neural networks etc.. The ultimate goal of this block is to classify each individual facial feature.
- **Result**
