# <h1 align="center">Image Processing Techniques


## **Scope of Image Processing**

- **Low level** Primitive operations e.g. noise reduction.
- **Mid level** extraction of attributes e.g. edges and contours.
- **High level** Analysis and interpretation.

## **Example of some image processing operations**

- **Sharpening**
- **Noise removal**
- **De-blurring**
- **Blurring**
- **Edge Extraction**
- **Binarization**
- **Contrast enhancement**
- **Object segmentation and labeling**

## **Commonly used terms**

- **Image Topology** involves investigation or fundamental image properties using morphological operators.
- **Neighborhood** pixels surrounding a given pixel.
- **Adjacency** the neighborhood of the Pixel. A neighborhood just means pixels surrounding a given pixel.
- **Paths**A 4-path between two pixels P and Q is a sequence of pixels starting with P and ending with Q, such that, each pixel in the sequence is 4-adjacent to its predecessor in the same sequence.
- **Components** A set of pixels connected to each other
- **Connectivity** Existence path between two pixels
- **Contrast enhancement**
- **Object segmentation and labeling**
