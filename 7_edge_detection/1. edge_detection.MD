# <h1 align="center">Edge Detection

## **Understand the concept of edge detection operators**
- **Prewitt Operator** and **Sobel Operator** used to detect vertical and horizontal edges.
- **Kirsch Operator** also known as direction masks used to detects in 8 compass directions.
- **Laplacian Operator** 2nd order derivative mask
## **Connectivity**
- 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity


## **The filter kernel**
- also known as *mask*

**Linear filtering steps**
- Define filter kernel
- -Slide kernel over image
- Multiply pixels under the kernel by weights
- Copy resulting value to same location in new image
