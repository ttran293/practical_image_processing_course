# <h1 align="center">Image Enhancement Techniques

## **Enhancement by filtering**
- **Spatial domain filtering** on the actual pixel rather than in the frequency domain
- Image Filters linear and non-linear


## **Connectivity**
- 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity


## **The filter kernel**
- also known as *mask*

**Linear filtering steps**
- Define filter kernel
- -Slide kernel over image
- Multiply pixels under the kernel by weights
- Copy resulting value to same location in new image
