# <h1 align="center">Introduction to Image Histogram

## **Histogram and Equalization**
**An image histogram** is a plot of the relative frequency of occurrence of each of the permitted pixel values in the image against the values themselves.  
A discrete probablity  density function which defines the likelihood of a given pixel value occuring within the image.  
X-axis is the range of values with in the image (0-255) for 8 bit grayscale.  Y-axis is number of times each value actually occurs within the particular image.

**Algorithm**

*initialize all histogram array entries to 0  
for each pixel I(i,j) within the image I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    hisogram(I(i,j)) = histogram(I(i,j)) + 1
    end*



**Histogram equalization** causes a histogram with bins (vertical lines) grouped closely together to "spread out" into flat or equalized histogram.
