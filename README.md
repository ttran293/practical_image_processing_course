# <h1 align="center">Practical Image Processing in C/C++ 


## **Overview**
- This is a course note and code from Practical Image Processing in C/C++ by Israel Gbati on Udemy
- The goal of this course is to present practical techniques while avoiding obstacles of abstract mathematical theories. 
- To achieve this goal, the image processing techniques are explained in plain language, not simply proven to be true through mathematical derivations.
