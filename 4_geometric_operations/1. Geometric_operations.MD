# <h1 align="center">Geometric Operations

## **Introduction**
**Geometric Operations** 
- Modify geometry of an image by repositioning pixels
- Rotate, flip, crop, resize
**Common uses of Geometric Operations** 
- Correcting geometric distortions
- Creatomg special effects
- As partof image registration

**Geometric Operations** consists of **mapping functions** and **interpolation methods**
Most geometric operations consist of two basic components. The mapping function and the interpolation methods.
The mapping function is typically specified using a set of spatial transformation equations.  
The interpolation methods are used to compute the new value of each pixel in the spatially transformed image.
